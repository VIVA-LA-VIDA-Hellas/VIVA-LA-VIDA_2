## 2 Why This Servo Was Chosen

### 1. **High torque at 5 V**
- Even at 5 V, the servo can hold steering angles under load.  
- Strong enough to resist forces when the robot pushes lightly against walls or during tight slalom-like turns.  

This ensures steering reliability throughout all three laps.

### 2. **Standard RC interface via PCA9685**
- MG996R uses the classic **50–60 Hz servo protocol**.  
- The PCA9685 provides:
  - **12-bit resolution PWM**  
  - Independent timing for all servo channels  
  - Zero CPU overhead for pulse generation  

This ensures precise and jitter-free steering angles without timing issues on the Raspberry Pi.

### 3. **Robust mechanical design**
- Metal gear train prevents stripping during sudden impacts.  
- Ball bearings improve durability under frequent directional changes.  
- Standard mounting holes and horn types simplify integration with the chassis.

This results in a durable, competition-ready steering assembly.

### 4. **Correct operating range for robot steering**
- Software uses:
  - **90°** → center  
  - ~**50°** → full left  
  - ~**130°** → full right  
- The MG996R easily supports this range while maintaining torque and precision.

This enables both tight turns around corners and smooth fine-angle corrections based on IMU feedback.

## 3 PCB and Power Integration

The servo connects to the electronics as follows:

- **PCA9685 Channel 0** → PWM steering command  
- **5 V servo rail** → high-current supply  
- **Ground** → shared with logic ground for stable signal reference  

### Advantages of this setup:
- Keeps **servo current** off the Raspberry Pi’s 3.3 V rail  
- Ensures timing stays synchronized with any additional servos  
- Avoids voltage dips on logic components when servo torque spikes  
- Provides stable, isolated power on a dedicated 5 V rail  

This architecture protects the controller while maintaining precise steering behavior.

## 4 Alternative Servos Considered

### 1. **SG90 / MG90S Micro Servos**
- **Pros:** cheap, lightweight  
- **Cons:** far too weak for steering; gear stripping risk  

### 2. **High-End Digital Servos (e.g., Savox, Futaba)**
- **Pros:** extremely precise and fast  
- **Cons:** expensive; unnecessary performance for WRO FE  

### 3. **Continuous-Rotation Servos**
- **Pros:** simple speed control  
- **Cons:** cannot hold an angle → unsuitable for steering mechanisms

## Summary

The **TowerPro MG996R** provides the optimal combination of **torque, durability, ease of control, and electrical compatibility** for the robot’s steering system. Its integration with the PCA9685 ensures reliable, precise angle control while maintaining electrical isolation and mechanical robustness.
